# How to run program

To run Whether the Weather, you must start both the front end and back end separately. To start the front end, open the back folder in your IDE of choice, navigate to Server.py and click the green play button to start the server. This should produce the link `http://locahost:3232` in the terminal, which you can navigate if you want to test the server on its own. You don't have to click the link. To run the front end, navigate to the directory `front/mock` in another IDE of choice, and run the command `npm start` in the terminal. This should produce the link `http://localhost:300` in the terminal, to which you can navigate to in a new browser page. This should load the page!
