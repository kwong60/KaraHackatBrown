Project Description:
We have four endpoints in this WebAPI. The loadcsv, viewcsv, searchcsv, and broadband endpoints
We satisfy the following User Stories

User Story 1 (Front-End Developer Stakeholder)
Mesh Network Community Coalition: "As a developer calling your web API, I can make API requests to
load, view, or search the contents of a CSV file by calling the `loadcsv`, `viewcsv` or `searchcsv`
endpoints. For `loadcsv`, I will provide the path of the CSV file to load (on the backend)."

User Story 2 (Front-End Developer Stakeholder)
Mesh Network Community Coalition: "As a developer calling your web API, I can retrieve the
percentage of households with broadband access for a target location by providing the name of the
target state and county in my request." (For our purposes in this sprint, we will say that
“broadband access” and “high-speed internet” are the same thing.)

How to use endpoints:

loadcsv - ex. http://localhost:3232/loadcsv?filepath=ri_income.csv"
param is filepath= inputted csvdata

viewcsv - ex. http://localhost:3232/viewcsv"
no params

searchcsv - ex. http://localhost:3232/searchcsv?term=Rhode+Island&hasheader=false&identifier=0
*third parameter is optional*
params are term= inputted term, hasheader= inputted boolean,
identifier= inputted identifier

broadband - ex. http://localhost:3232/broadband?state=California&county=Kings+County
*county parameter is optional* make sure to use + for spaces
params are state= inputted state, county= inputted county

Design choices:

We have a high level server class that runs main.
This server class contains our 4 endpoints and shares state variables through the design choice of
static variables and static getter and setter methods

The loadcsv, viewcsv,and searchcsv endpoints use the shared static variable parsedLoadedCSV and
getter/setter methods to load, view, and search the csvfile.

The broadband endpoint uses the static variable stateCode to store the stateCode mappings,
preventing redundant "state to stateCode" queries to the census API

We return the required json map<String, Object> type for all our API outputs.
